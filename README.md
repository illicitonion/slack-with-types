# slack-with-types

slack-with-types offers a client to the [Slack Web APIs](https://api.slack.com/methods) in Rust. It is unofficial, and has no connection to Slack or Salesforce.

The focus of this client is type-guided APIs (e.g. with plenty of newtypes), and robust handling of rate limiting.

This is a very partial client, adding types on demand, and currently offers no stability guarantees version-to-version.
